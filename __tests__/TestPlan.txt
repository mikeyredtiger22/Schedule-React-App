Tests:

    All:
        Props are handled by PropTypes
        Use Jest Snapshots for each Component (overwrite when changing UI)
        Using Enzyme to allow extra testing functionality

    App:
        Doesn't render ScheduleTables before apiCall response is received
        Renders ScheduleTables if apiCall response has been received
        Always renders NameTable and Wheel

    NameTable:
        NameTableRow count matches props.names length
        Every name in props.names is present in a NameTableRow
        Table, input and button are always rendered
        Button click event calls props.handleNewName when nameInput is non-empty
        Button click event doesn't call props.handleNewName when nameInput is empty
        Click event on delete icon calls props.handleRemoveName
        Worker limit message displayed when NameTableRow count (or props.names) == 10
        Worker limit message not displayed when NameTableRow count (or props.names) != 10

    ScheduleTable:
        One "Week 1" table and one "Week 2" table (check first <th>)
        In each table:
            All props.names are contained in the table
            All cells in table are non-empty
            Table contains 8 <th> and 10 <td> elements
            props.names are positioned in table according to props.data

    Wheel:
        Renders Image
        If state.rotating == true then image className == "rotating"
        If state.rotating == false then image has no className
        Image click event changes state.rotating to true if state.rotating = false
        Image click event doesn't change state.rotating if state.rotating = true
        Image click event calls props.handleReload if state.rotating = true
        Image click event doesn't call props.handleReload if state.rotating = false
        2 seconds after Wheel.handleReload, state.rotating == false
